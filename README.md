# Image-regeneration-using-Metropolis-Hastings-algorithm
The code regenerates a black and white image of any image input using Metropolis Hastings algorithm. 

The user inputs any image, and the Python code turns the image into a black and white image. Each pixel is thus given a value between 0 and 255. Every pixel is then normalized such that we get a normalized probability distribution in $\mathbb{R}^2$ from the image itself. The Metropolis Hastings algorithm then samples from this distribution.

Eventually, after many iterations, the converged probability distribution is plotted, and the image will successfully be recreated from pure randomness. See the images above.
